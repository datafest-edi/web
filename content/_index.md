## Competition starts May 30!

There is currently a lot of work being done on modeling direct health outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as prediction new cases or mortality rates. You can read more about the complexities of doing such analyses in the article ["Why It’s So Freaking Hard to Make a Good COVID-19 Model”](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-so-freaking-hard-to-make-a-good-covid-19-model/).

For this competition, we challenge you to explore the societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic other than its direct health outcomes. You can explore everything from the effects on pollution levels, transportation levels, or working from home. You can investigate changes in the number of people posting on TikTok with their families or do an analysis on online education. The focus is up to you! We just encourage you to be thoughtful and creative as you analyze data and communicate your insights about some of pandemic's impacts on society.

The challenge for this DataFest event is to

- choose an outcome such as one of these (or something entirely different we haven’t thought of here!),
- find the appropriate data to explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on this issue, and
- present your findings (along with the dataset you used).

Finally, we have always framed ASA DataFest as a collaborative competition, but this is even more true this year. Local judges will still recognize projects that stand out from the rest on categories like Best Insight, Best Visualization, and Most Creative Data set or Topic, but we encourage you, now more than ever, to share sources you found useful, approaches you found to be fruitful, or methods you want to learn more about with each other.

## Ready to join the competition?

Click to [Sign up](/signup) for the event by Saturday, May 30 at 11:59pm BST. (We anticipate that some of you who were planning to participate in the original DataFest may not be able to participate in this virtual version and some others who couldn't do the in person event might now be interested. So we ask that everyone signs up again so we get an accurate headcount.)

On Friday we will start with a reception where your surprise client will give a brief introduction to the data you will be working with over the weekend and tell you a bit about what they would like to get out of it. The data will likely be much more complex than what you are used to seeing in your classes, and you will be given free reign to analyze it however you like. In other words, you will come up with a research question that is of interest to you, and conduct the appropriate analysis to answer your question. But you are welcomed, and encouraged, to take cues from the client's introduction when shaping your research question(s).

Presentations and judging will begin ~3pm on Sunday. Each team will give a brief (5 minute) presentation of their findings to a panel of judges comprised of faculty and professionals from a variety of fields. There will be prizes in many categories, such as best visualization, best use of external data, and best findings. A finalized list of categories will be announced at the beginning of the competition.
