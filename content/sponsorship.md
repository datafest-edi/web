ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> at University of Edinburgh cannot run without your support!

There are three ways you can support ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> as either an individual or a business:

- **Please consider visiting as a Visiting Consultant.** Spend an hour or two getting to know the students and offering your sage advice. This is an excellent recruiting opportunity; you get to watch students working in teams, under pressure, striving to understand possibly the most complex data set they have encountered. In fact, each year, several students have received internships and interviews that have led to full-time employment. Success at DataFest requires that a team have a combination of computational, statistical, and human skills, as well as the ability to communicate clearly and extremely concisely.

- **Please consider a financial contribution and, in particular, asking your employer to contribute.** We are seeking to raise £10,000 to cover food and facility expenses. Not sure how much to contribute? See below for our sponsorship levels. For questions, please contact Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, faculty coordinator, at [mcetinka@ed.ac.uk](mailto:mcetinka@ed.ac.uk).

### Visiting

We welcome professionals who work in data-related fields, as well as academics and researchers, to join us as VIP Consultants. We will provide you with some information about the data challenge before your arrival. Once you arrive, we hope you’ll enjoy wandering the room and dispensing wisdom and advice. You’ll also find that ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> is a great place to scout future talent! Where else can you observe students working with a team on a real problem under intense deadline pressure?

Visiting ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> will be fun and relaxing, as we strive to keep the mood light. However, if you do sign up for a time, please notify us if you must make any changes or if you cannot come. Students often pay attention to when people from particular companies visit, and we also must ensure the number of people in the hall does not exceed the capacity.

### Giving

We welcome financial donations from individuals and businesses. Donations are used to provide food, prizes, and supplies. 

Your financial support benefits the ASA DataFest<small><sup>TM</sup></small> @ University of Edinburgh, and specifically the students that participate in the event. Any residual funds will be used towards promoting and planning the event for the following year.

Sponsors will be provided with various advertising and recruiting opportunities. But equally important is your time! Please consider visiting us as a "VIP Consultant". Drop by for a couple of hours and talk to the teams to point them in the right direction. It's a wonderful recruiting opportunity and lots of fun, too. We ask that visitors sign up for a time slot so that we'll know when to expect you, but we won't hold you to it.
