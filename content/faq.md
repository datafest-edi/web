#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> How do I sign up?

Click <a href="/signup">here</a> to sign up. Please fill out the form fully. You can sign up as a 4-5 (gets priority) or 2-3 person team or leave us your information to be matched with others looking for teams. Seats are limited, so register early! The registration deadline is **Friday, 21 February, at 17:00**.

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Is there a registration fee?

No, there is no registration fee. However note that the event takes significant 
resources to run. So, if you sign up, we expect that you show up! If your plans 
change, [let us know](mailto:mcetinka@ed.ac.uk) ASAP so we can make your spot 
available to someone else.

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Who is eligible to compete?</h4>

All University of Edinburgh undergraduate students are eligible. Note that we 
only have space for 100 students, so act fast to sign up!

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What about MSc and PhD students?

We would love to have MSc and PhD students get involved as consultants during 
the event.

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> How large are the teams?

Teams can be made up of 2-5 students, but teams of 4-5 students will be given 
priority.

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Do I have to compete in a team?

Yes, but if you don't have a team in mind, leave us your info and we'll match you 
with others in the same boat.

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What do I need to compete?

All you need is a laptop with tools for data analysis (there is no limitation on 
which software you use) and enthusiasm for data. See [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/using-library/borrowing-a-book/borrowing-laptops) for information on the university's laptop loan service. You can borrow one for the event from the library!

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What are the rules of the competition?

The rules are very simple:

  + No more than five students per team.
  + No fewer than 2 students per team.
  + Team members can come and go as they please but all work has to be done on-site. A steady supply of food, beverage, and candy make it more inviting to stay.
  + It's a competition, but a friendly one, so collaboration between teams is not only allowed but highly encouraged. Official ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> consultants (grad students, faculty, data professionals, etc.) will also be around throughout the weekend to help with any questions you might have. However you can't have outside help.
  
#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Do we have to stay the entire time?

No. You may come and go as you please. However, you are not allowed to work on the project except while you are on ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> grounds (i.e. at Bayes Centre), and at least 3 members of your team must attend the introduction.

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> What can I win?

ASA student memberships, medals, books, fame, glory, or some combination thereof... And you get a t-shirt!

#### <i class="fas fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i> Where else is ASA DataFest<sup><small>TM</small></sup> happening?</h4>
